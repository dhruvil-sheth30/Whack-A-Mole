# Whack-a-Mole Game

Welcome to Whack-a-Mole, a digital rendition of the classic arcade game! This project is part of my Front-End Engineering and Development (FEWD) Course Assignment 2 at MIT-ADT Pune. The motivation behind creating this game stems from my fond memories of playing Whack-a-Mole as a favorite arcade game during my childhood.
